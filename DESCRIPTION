Description: The **DiscrimOD** package adopts a hybrid algorithm
  to search for the optimal discrimination designs
  when there are two or more than two competing models
  under normal or non-normal error assumption.
  This hybrid algorithm is chosen to efficiently solve the maximin design criteria
  in the optimal discrimination design problem which is usually a challenging task.
  It combines the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm and the L-BFGS algorithm
  to tackle the outer and inner objectives of the maximin design criterion, respectively.
  The equivalence theorems for various discrimination criteria are also available for
  verifying the optimal discrimination designs.
